# DAT250 â€“ Experiment Assignment 2

## Technical problems
I experienced some issues in IntelliJ when working with the packages in the project. At first the structure was unclear, and some files did not appear where I expected them to be. This was resolved by reorganizing the package layout, after this the project compiled and ran as intended.

## Pending issues
There does not seem to be any major pending issues. The REST API seems to have been implemented successfully. It was tested using Bruno, where I created and executed the test scenarios automatically. Everything behaved as expected.
