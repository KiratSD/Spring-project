# DAT250 â€“ Experiment Assignment 3

## Technical problems
During this experiment I encountered some small technical issues:
- I did not have Node.js and npm installed correctly at first, so I had to install them manually before starting the frontend project.
- I had some trouble placing the generated frontend build files into the correct location in the Spring Boot project. Initially I put them in the wrong folder, which caused a 404 error.
- There were also some smaller layout issues in the Svelte components, but these were solved by adjusting the CSS.

## Pending issues
I was able to complete the assignment successfully. The deployed frontend is now integrated with the backend API. There does not seem to be any pending issues.
