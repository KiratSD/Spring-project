# DAT250 â€“ Experiment Assignment 7

## Summary
I used Docker to containerize the PollApp.  
I created a simple Dockerfile, built the image, and ran the container locally.

## Technical problems and pending issues
I made sure Docker was installed and running.  
There did not seem to be any issues, and everything worked as expected.
