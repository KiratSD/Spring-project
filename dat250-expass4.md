# DAT250 â€“ Experiment Assignment 4

## Technical problems
I had issues with missing dependencies and build errors at first. I solved these after updating with the correct dependencies and refreshing Gradle.

## Database inspection
Using the H2 database, I confirmed that tables for `users`, `polls`, `vote_options`, and `votes` were created. Running `PollsTest` verified that the data was stored and queries worked as expected.

## Pending issues
There does not seem to be any major pending issues. All tests passed successfully.
